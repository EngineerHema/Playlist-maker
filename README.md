# Spotify Playlist Creator

This project is a Python-based application that creates a playlist on Spotify with the top songs from a specific year. The application uses **Tkinter** for the GUI, integrates **APIs** (including the Spotify API), and leverages **web scraping** to fetch the top songs list from the web.

## Features

- **Spotify API Integration:** Automatically creates a playlist on Spotify using the user's account.
- **Web Scraping:** Retrieves the top songs for a specified year from popular charts like Billboard.
- **User-Friendly GUI:** Built with Tkinter to allow easy interaction and selection of the desired year.
- **Custom Playlist Creation:** The program gathers songs from the scraped data and creates a custom playlist in the user's Spotify account.
- **APIs:** Integrated Spotify API and others for data handling.
